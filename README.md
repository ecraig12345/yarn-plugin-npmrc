# `yarn-plugin-npmrc`

This plugin implements registry authentication using settings from `.npmrc`, following most of the same logic as `npm` itself.

Pulling credentials from `.npmrc` can be helpful for repos migrating from another package manager, or for interoperability with other tools.

## Install

Usually you'll want the minified version of the plugin:

```
yarn plugin import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecraig12345/yarn-plugin-npmrc/v0.3.1/dist/plugin-npmrc.js
```

If you'd like a non-minified version for debugging:

```
yarn plugin import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecraig12345/yarn-plugin-npmrc/v0.3.1/dist/plugin-npmrc.dev.js
```

## Usage

If migrating from another package manager or yarn v1:

1. Generate credentials and save in `.npmrc` following your usual method
1. If you were using the `.npmrc` settings `registry` or `always-auth`, those must be moved to `.yarnrc.yml`: [`npmRegistryServer`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#npmRegistryServer), [`npmAlwaysAuth`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#npmAlwaysAuth), or the [scope-specific](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#npmScopes) or [registry-specific](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#npmRegistries) versions of those settings

In all cases:

1. Import the plugin as above
1. In your `.yarnrc.yml`, add: `npmrcAuthEnabled: true`
1. Run `yarn` or other commands

## Notes

This plugin uses [`@npmcli/config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@npmcli/config) to read the effective npm config: applying `process.env.NPM_CONFIG_*`, project config, user config, and global config. There are a couple limitations:

- CLI args aren't respected, since they might interfere with yarn's processing.
- Environment variable replacement only supports variables from the actual process environment, not variables that would normally be added to the environment by npm. (This should have no impact on auth-related values in most cases; the only time it might cause issues is advanced modifications to the `prefix` or config paths which are then referenced as environment variables in a config.)
- Certificate or key-based auth (`certfile`, `keyfile`) aren't supported.

The version of `@npmcli/config` is patched locally (with the patch included in the plugin bundle) to address some issues and reduce the plugin bundle size.

### Why patch `@npmcli/config`?

The initial motivation was to get rid of a problematic `require.resolve('node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js')`, which assumes the code is running within the `npm` package with its dependencies and causes a runtime error if `node-gyp` isn't present locally. That code isn't needed at all for auth, so patching to remove it was the simplest approach.

The other reason for patching is to remove a bunch of code which isn't relevant to auth settings. The patch takes the plugin down from **220k to 28k** (minified), which matters because **Yarn loads _every plugin_ on _every command_**, even if the plugin isn't used by that command. So parsing a plugin with a bunch of unused bundled code is potentially a meaningful perf penalty when running `yarn build` or other commands across many packages in a large repo.

(Arguably at this point the patch has gone a bit overboard and it would be better to just copy the relevant parts of the code, but there's some complex/nuanced behavior for config path modifications using environment variables which would be hard to pull out.)

#### What's patched

- Remove all unneeded option `definitions` (including the one referencing `node-gyp`) and logic specific to those options
- Pass in the workspace/package and project roots (since yarn has already found these) and remove all the logic and dependencies related to finding `package.json` and matching its `workspaces` globs (allows removing large glob-related dependencies)
- Remove option definition descriptions and related logging code
- Remove CLI arg support
- Remove all unused methods
- Add partial typing support (not included in bundle) for easier development

#### Modifying the patch

The directory generated by `yarn patch @npmcli/config` (with the original `source` and modified `user` versions of the package) is checked in under `patches/@npmcli-config`.

If you just want to modify the patch contents, not update to the latest version, do the following:

1. Make modifications under `patches/@npmcli-config/user`
1. From the repo root, run `yarn patch-commit -s patches/@npmcli-config/user`
1. If the old patch file is still present under `.yarn/patches`, delete it
1. Don't forget to run `yarn` again to apply the new patch and update the lock file, and `yarn build` to update the bundles

#### Updating the patched version

To update `@npmcli/config` to the latest version and re-apply the patch:

1. In `package.json`, change the version of `@npmcli/config` to the desired registry version, and run `yarn`
1. Delete `patches/@npmcli-config`
1. Copy the **parent** of the listed folder to `patches/@npmcli-config`: e.g. if the logged version if `/<some temp path>/abcdef/user`, copy `/<some temp path>/abcdef`
1. Substituting the previous patch file name, run `git apply --reject --directory=patches/@npmcli-config/user .yarn/patches/@npmcli-config-npm-<SUFFIX>.patch`
1. If there are any `.rej` files, manually apply any rejected diffs (you can look at the diff in the `source` directory for help) and delete the `.rej` files
